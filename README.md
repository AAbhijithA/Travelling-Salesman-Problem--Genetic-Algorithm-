# Travelling Salesman Problem [Genetic-Algorithm]
### Applyling Genetic Algorithm on TSP problem by running it over 400 iterations by 
>* Crossover (source/destination cross)
>* Mutation 
>* Evaluation of fitness for the next set of population to get the sub-optimal answer.
#### Note: Done in C++ due to comfort of the STL libraries for implementation of data-structures
